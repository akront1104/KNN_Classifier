# KNN_Classifier
Implement KNN Classifier

1a. Report test accuracies when k=1,5,11,21,41,61,81,101,201,401 without normalizing the features.
1b. Report test accuracies when k=1,5,11,21,41,61,81,101,201,401 with z-score normalization applied to the features.
1c. Generate an ouput of KNN predicted labels for the first 50 instnaces (i.e. t1-t50) when k=1,5,11,21,41,61,81,101,201,401 (in this order).
